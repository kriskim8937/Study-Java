## Dependency_Injection

## What is?
- dependency injection is a technique whereby one object supplies the dependencies of another object
- Dependency injection is one form of the broader technique of inversion of control.
- This means the client does not need to know about the injector, how to construct the services, or even which actual services it is using.
- The client only needs to know about the intrinsic interfaces of the services because these define how the client may use the services. 
- This separates the responsibility of "use" from the responsibility of "construction".
## Why?
- Dependency Injection solves problems such as
  - How can an application or class be independent of how its objects are created?
  - How can the way objects are created be specified in separate configuration files?
  - How can an application support different configurations?
